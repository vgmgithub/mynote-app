// Card record shape (creditCards store, IndexedDB v13):
//   { id, name,                                  // 'Swiggy HDFC CC'
//     bank,                                      // 'HDFC' — the issuer, several cards can share one
//     creditLimit,                               // ₹ sanctioned limit (optional — blank means "not tracked")
//     cycleStartDay, cycleEndDay,                 // billing cycle, e.g. 8 -> 7 (day-of-month, 1-31). Drives cycleWindow(), which decides which statement a spend lands on. A statement is named for the month its cycle CLOSES in - the month the bill is paid
//     months: [{ ym:'YYYY-MM', billed, status, paidOn }],  // one row per statement month
//     createdAt, updatedAt }
//
// `billed` is the statement total for that month. `status` is how that
// month's bill was settled: null/'' (not yet paid), 'ontime', or 'late' —
// set via a dropdown per row (app.js buildCcMonthEditor), not a text amount.
// `paidOn` is the ISO date `status` last changed away from unpaid, kept for
// display only ("paid on dd/mm").
//
// Reimbursement is NOT tracked per card any more (it was — see git history —
// but reimbursement represents home spending logged elsewhere, credited back
// as ONE combined figure, which was never really allocable to a specific
// card). It's now a single amount per MONTH, shared across every card billed
// that month, stored in the separate `ccReimbursements` store (db.js) and
// passed into computeCredit() as a plain {ym: amount} map — computeCard()
// below never sees it, since a single card can't sensibly claim a fraction
// of a combined monthly reimbursement on its own.
//
// The source sheet holds this as a wide grid: one ROW per card, one COLUMN per
// month (A:AB = the label column plus 27 months), with Total / Last Month
// Difference / to be PAID / AVERAGE as summary rows underneath. That shape is
// reproduced for DISPLAY in app.js, but stored per-card-with-months instead —
// a column-per-month store would need a schema change every new month.
